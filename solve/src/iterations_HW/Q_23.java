Write a program to print the first 15 numbers of the Pell series. In mathematics, the Pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers. 
The sequence of Pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and then each Pell number is the sum of twice the previous Pell number and the Pell number before that.: 
The first few terms of the
sequence are : 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378, 5741, 13860,…
