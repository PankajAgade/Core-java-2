Write a program to check whether a number is a Harshad Number or not.
In recreational mathematics, a harshad number in a given number base, is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base.
Example: Number 200 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 2 and 0 and 0 is 2(2+0+0) and 200 is divisible by 2. 
Number 171 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 1 and 7 and 1 is 9(1+7+1) and 171 is divisible by 9.
